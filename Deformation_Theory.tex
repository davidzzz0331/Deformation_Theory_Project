\section{Introduction}
In the section, we will introduce the definitions and intuition for first order deformations. 

\subsection{Intuition}
\textbf{Embedded Deformation}: Suppose we have a smooth submanifold $X$ embedded an ambient complex manifold $Y$. The embedding is equipped with a normal bundle $N_YX$. By the tubular neighborhood theorem, we have a embedding of its total space: 

\[\begin{tikzcd}
	X && Y \\
	& {N_YX}
	\arrow[hook, from=1-1, to=1-3]
	\arrow["{\textrm{0-section}}"', from=1-1, to=2-2]
	\arrow[dotted, hook, from=2-2, to=1-3]
\end{tikzcd}\]

A smooth deformation of $Y$ inside $X$ is then a smooth section of $N_YX$: at each point $x\in X$, the section give you the normal direction along which to ``infinitesimally" deform $X$ inside $Y$. This definition offers some differential topologically intuition, even though we no longer have an analog of the tubular neighborhood theorem in the holomorphic/algebraic setting.

More generally, we are given the data of 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A morphism of objects $f: X\to Y$ in some category (e.g. schemes, complex manifolds, etc).
    \item An ``infinitesimal thickening" of $X$ and $Y$, which are prescribed injective morphisms $X\to X'$ and $Y\to Y'$.
\end{enumerate}

A deformation of $f$ is then a lift of the morphism $X\to Y$ to a morphism $X'\to Y'$
\[\begin{tikzcd}
	X & Y \\
	{X'} & {Y'}
	\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
	\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]
	\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]
	\arrow["{?}"', dotted, from=2-1, to=2-2]
\end{tikzcd}\]

\textbf{Deformation of Complex Structure}: Viewing a complex manifold $X$ as a real manifold with an integrable almost complex structure $J$, a deformation of the complex structure is a family of almost complex structures $J_t$ parametrized by $t\in (-\epsilon, \epsilon)$ such that $J_0 = J$ and each $J_t$ is integrable. Infinitesimally, we can think of this as a perturbation of the almost complex structure $J$ by a small parameter $t$ in the space of endomorphisms of the tangent bundle $TX$ that satisfy $J_t^2 = -\mathrm{Id}$ and the integrability condition (vanishing of the Nijenhuis tensor).


The theory of Kodaira-Spencer describes how such deformations can be understood in terms of certain cohomology groups associated with the manifold. More precisely, first order deformations of the complex structure on $X$ are classified by the cohomology group $H^1(X, T_X)$, where $T_X$ is the holomorphic tangent bundle of $X$.





\textbf{Deformation and Moduli Problem}
In relation to deformation of complex structure, suppose we have concretely constructed the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_g$ parameterizing smooth projective curves of genus $g$. A point $[C]\in \mathcal{M}_g$ corresponds to an isomorphism class of a smooth projective curve $C$ of genus $g$. A deformation of the curve $C$ can be thought of as a small perturbation of the complex structure on $C$, leading to a family of curves $C_t$ parameterized by a small parameter $t$. Infinitesimally, this corresponds to moving along a tangent vector at the point $[C]$ in the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_g$. The tangent space at $[C]$ can be identified with the first cohomology group $H^1(C, T_C)$, where $T_C$ is the holomorphic tangent bundle of the curve $C$.

Suppose we have a fine moduli space $\mathcal{M}$ parameterizing certain objects, meaning any family of such objects over a base $B$ is given by a morphism 
\[B\to \mathcal{M}\]
Then an infinitesimal deformation of an object $X$ corresponding to a point $[X]\in \mathcal{M}$ is given by a family over the dual numbers $\mathrm{Spec}(\mathbb{C}[\epsilon]/(\epsilon^2))$ (we can think of the dual numbers as a point equipped with a tangent vector), such that the fiber over $0$ is isomorphic to $X$. Then, the classifying map 
\[T_0B\to T_{[X]}\mathcal{M}\]
precisely specifies a tangent vector at $[X]$.

\section{First Order Deformation}
\begin{definition}
	The \textbf{dual numbers} over a field $k$ is the ring 
	\[D:= k[t]/(t^2)\]
\end{definition}
Note that $\Spec(D)$ is the one-point space consisting of the prime ideal $(t)$. Its Zariski tangent space is given by 
\[T_{(t)}D:= \Hom_k ((t)/(t^2),k) \]
which is a one-dimensional $k$-vector space. In contrast, $\Spec(k)$ is also a one-point space, but its Zariski tangent space is zero-dimensional. Thus, we can think of $\Spec(D)$ as a point equipped with a tangent vector. The dual numbers will be our base space for first order deformations.


\begin{definition}
	\label{deformation_def}
	Let $Y$ be a scheme over $k$, and $X$ be a closed subscheme. A \textbf{first order embedded deformation} of $X$ in $Y$ is a closed subscheme $X'\subset Y\times_k \Spec (D)$ such that 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $X'$ is flat over $D$
		\item The fiber over the point is $X$, i.e 
		\[X'\times_{\Spec(D)}\Spec(k)= X\]
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
We would like to classify all such deformations. 

\subsection{Embedded Deformation of Affine Schemes}
\subsection{An Easy Example}
We first inspect the following example: first-order embedded deformations of a curve $C$ in $\mathbb{A}_k^2$. Translating Definition \ref{deformation_def} into algebra, we have the following setup:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item We are given curve $C$ carved out by $f(x,y)$, embedded in $\mathbb{A}^2$ via the canonical map 
	 \[k[x,y]\to k[x,y]/(f)\]
	\item An embedded deformation $\mathcal{A}$ is a quotient of 
	\[k[x,y]\otimes_k D\cong D[x,y]\]
	i.e of the form $\mathcal{A}= D[x,y]/I$, where $I=(\phi)$ \textcolor{red}{why principal?}, such that $\mathcal{A}$ is a flat $D$-algebra, and an isomorphism 
	\[D[x,y]/(\phi)\to k[x,y]/(f)\]
	induced by sending the generator $t\in D$ to $0$.
\end{enumerate}
Intuitively, the defining equation for the curve can be expressed as a finite sum
\[f(x,y)=\sum_{i,j}a_{ij}x^iy^j\]
where $a_{ij}\in k$. The deformation, defined by the vanishing of $\phi(x,y)$, is of the form
\[\phi(x,y)=\sum_{i,j}(a_{ij}+b_{ij}t)x^iy^j \]
so the polynomial $g(x,y)=\sum_{i,j}b_{ij}x^iy^j$ determines the deformation, and can be thought of as the ``deformed'' $f$. However, writing out explicit defining equations as above requires choices up to a unit, i.e $(\phi)=(u\phi)$ as ideals for any unit $u$.

\begin{lemma}
	The units in $k[x,y]$ are $k^*$. The units in $D[x,y]$ are of the form $c+ht$, where $c\in k^*$, and $h\in k[x,y]$. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	The first statement is easy by Gauss lemma. For the second statement, suppose we have $f=\sum_{i,j}(a_{ij}+b_{ij}t)x^iy^j$ and $g=\sum_{i,j}(a'_{ij}+b'_{ij}t)x^iy^j$ such that $fg=1$. By inductively looking at coefficients of the expanded product, we see we must have $a_{00}=a^{-1}_{00}$, and all other $a_{ij}=0$. 
\end{proof}



\begin{proposition}
The set of first order embedded deformations of $C$ in $\mathbb{A}^2$ is in bijection with elements in $k[x,y]/(f)$. 
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	We already see that the deformation is determined by a choice of $g$ and let $\phi=f+gt$. Suppose another choice $g'$ yields the same deformation, i.e 
	\[f+g't=u\phi=cf+(fh+cg)t\]
we see $c=1$, and $g'=fh+g$, so $g$ and $g'$ define the same element in $k[x,y]/(f)$. 
\end{proof}

\subsection{General Results}
Suppose $X=\Spec(B)$ is affine, and $Y$ is a closed subscheme defined by an ideal $I\subset B$. We see that first-order embedded deformations of $Y$ in $X$ correspond to ideals $J\subset B':= B[t]/(t^2)$ such that 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $B'/J$ is flat over $D$
	\item The image of $J$ under the canonical collapse 
	\[B[t]/(t^2)\to B\]
	is $I$.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{proposition}
	There is a bijection between the set of first-order embedded deformations of $Y$ in $X$ and $\mathrm{Hom}_B (I, B/I)$.
\end{proposition}
To prove the proposition, we first need a characterization of flatness. 
\begin{lemma}
	Let $A'\to A$ be a surjective homomorphism of Noetherian rings with kernel $J$ such that $J^2=0$. An $A'$-module $M'$ is flat over $A'$ if and only if the following are satisfied:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $M:=M'\otimes_{A'}A$ is flat over $A$
		\item the canonical map $M \otimes_A J\to M'$ is injective.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Note that since $J^2=0$, the ideal $J$ is automatically an $A\cong A'/J$ module, and 
	\[M\otimes_A J\cong (M'\otimes_{A'}A)\otimes_A J\cong M'\otimes_{A'}J\]
so the second criterion makes sense. The forward direction is clear:  the first criterion follows from the fact that  flatness is preserved under base change; the second criterion follows from the exactness of the functor $-\otimes_{A'} M'$, applied to the short exact sequence
\[ 0\to J\to A'\to A\to 0\]


\end{proof}
